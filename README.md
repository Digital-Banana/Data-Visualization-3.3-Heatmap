When are Stack Exchange users most active based on their answering rate? Datasets of seven subsites reveal peaks and drops in activity throughout the day.

Iâ€™ve gathered datasets of seven random Stack Exchange subsites discussing a wide range of subjects such as fitness, gardening and woodworking. I then use the total amounts of answers per hour per site to visualize peaks and drops in daily activity over a five year period, from 2011 to 2016.

The following heatmaps reveal the average amount of hourly activity per site.
